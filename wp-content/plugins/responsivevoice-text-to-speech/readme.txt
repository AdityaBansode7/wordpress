### Features:
* Listen to any post or page with the tap of a button
* Shortcodes to place Listen button anywhere on the post or page
* 51 languages supported through 168 voices
* Unlimited text to speech
* Easy access to content for website users, tap to listen to your page or post read aloud
* A more functional website for a range of users including visually impaired and the elderly
* Web Accessibility Compliance Group 2.0, ADA and BS 8878:2010 features

### Usage:

* From version 1.6.6, we added API Key configuration to Wordpress settings. To experience the complete range of voices,
[register free and get your API Key](https://responsivevoice.org/register). The plugin will still work without it, but
you will be limited to available browser voices.

* It's Easy - To have the Listen button appear put the following shortcode anywhere in the text of your page or post.
`[responsivevoice_button]`

You can select a voice by using the "voice" parameter, and change the text that appears on the button with the "buttontext" parameter. The following shortcode will read in the US English Female voice, and the button will say "Play".
`[responsivevoice_button voice="US English Female" buttontext="Play"]`
A full list of ResponsiveVoice names is available at [Documentation](https://responsivevoice.org/text-to-speech-languages/). Default is UK English Female.

* Read a whole page, or just sections of text - If you don't want the whole page or post to be read, just surround the salient text with
`[responsivevoice]Text you want ResponsiveVoice to read [/responsivevoice]`
This tag also supports the voice and buttontext parameters. Additionally, you can place the button after the text (it will be before by default) with the "buttonposition" tag, like so:
`[responsivevoice buttonposition="after"]Text you want ResponsiveVoice to read [/responsivevoice]`

The shortcodes also allow other parameters. You can adjust the Voice's pitch, volume and rate with
`[responsivevoice_button rate="1" pitch="1.2" volume="0.8" voice="US English Female" buttontext="Play"]`

For more details, please see the [Documentation](https://responsivevoice.org/wordpress-text-to-speech-plugin/)
